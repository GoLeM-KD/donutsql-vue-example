# IMPORTANT

**Vue.js is a browser-based framework, so credentials and other configuration values used directly in the client-side application may be exposed to users.**

Therefore, **do not use this architecture for applications that handle sensitive data or require secret credentials to remain confidential.**

If you are building a Vue.js application that requires secure database access, we recommend using a **server-side backend** such as **Express.js, Next.js, or another suitable server-side framework/runtime** to establish the DonutSQL connection.

In this architecture, your DonutSQL credentials remain securely on the server and are not exposed to the browser.
